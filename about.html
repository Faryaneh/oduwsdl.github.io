                <p class="text-black-50">
                        The Dark and Stormy Archives (DSA) project exists to provide storytelling solutions to improve the understanding of web archive collections. With search engines, collection users must first have a query in mind. What if the user does not know enough about the collection to form a query? Our goal is to provide a "summary of summaries" in the form of social media storytelling that describes a collection sufficiently for a user to decide if that collection merits further time.

                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                        <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Problem-of-History-in-the/238600">Historians</a>, <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february06/arms/02arms.html">social scientists</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/health/dermatology-skin-cancer.html">journalists</a> use web archives to understand human behavior. Creating collections is not limited to researchers. Organizations archive their own web presence and libraries focus on curating content specific to their communities. These collections gain further value when they are explored again by future users.

                        The curators of these collections implied aboutness by centering these collections on a specific topic. Thanks to this work, users of these collections interested in that topic do not need to search the web, or even full web archives, to find a set of pages on that topic.

                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                        Web archive collections are different from other document collections because they have different versions of the same page over time. These versions have value because they allow users to see how events unfolded in a news story, or how organizations change over time. This <em>temporal component</em> means that web archive collections require different summarization and visualization techniques than other document collections.

                        Tools like <a href="https://www.archive-it.org">Archive-It</a> and <a href="https://webrecorder.io">Webrecorder</a> exist to allow users to create collections of archived web pages easily. These tools have allowed organizations to easily preserve their history and historians to document events as they unfold.

                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                        Curators choose web pages as <strong>seeds</strong> for the web archive collection. Web archives save each version of a web page as a <strong>memento</strong>. Some collections contain thousands of seeds and every capture of a seed results in one or more mementos. If a potential user wants to review a collection to understand it, they may need to review thousands of mementos.

                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                        Because collections are easy to create, there are many collections about the same topic. For example, searches on Archive-It the topic &quot;human rights&quot; results in 31 collections for a user to review.

                        There were more than 4,000 public Archive-It collections by the end of 2016, and this number has grown to 5,857 by March 2019.

                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                        With other document collections, metadata is an invaluable tool for understanding the collection and its contents. For example, <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november99/11pitti.html">Encoded Archival Description (EAD)</a> exists for collections, and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/96principl.html">MAchine-Readable Cataloguing (MARC)</a> exists for books. These standards exist so that users can compare items to each other. Even though Archive-It provides fields from Dublin Core, supplying metadata on individual seeds or a whole collection is optional. When present, the metadata is generated by different curators from different organizations with different content standards and different rules of interpretation. Thus, even when present, users cannot reliably compare metadata on web archive collections in order to understand them.

                        We can sample the colleciton to find the mementos that best represent it so that users can understand it. From there, we can visualize the mementos with social media storytelling. Social media storytelling visualizes web pages as <strong>surrogates</strong>, like cards and browser thumbnails.

                        A user viewing these <strong>stories</strong> should now understand the collection well enough to determine if it meets their needs, thus saving them time and effort.
